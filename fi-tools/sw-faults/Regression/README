In this folder several scripts can be found that should be used to ensure that there are no regression among different versions of the fault injector.
There might be the need of editing certain variables at the top of each script before running the script. These variables usually hold the position of the JAR of the injector that we want to test, and/or the test results that we want to compare with.

run_regression.sh -> Runs a current version of the injector over a certain test suite and compares the results (patches) generated by the current version against the ones created by the old version.

store_testsuite_results.sh -> Runs a current version of the injector over a certain test suite and saves all the results in a new folder. This folder follows a certain format, and can later be used for comparison/regression testing (by feeding it to run_regression.sh for example).

attempt_testsuite_compilation.sh -> Tries to apply and compile all the patches of the testsuite. Can be used to make sure that all the produced patches are valid/compilable.
